# Vehicle Specification Extraction System

A RAG-based system to extract structured vehicle specifications from service manual PDFs using a Streamlit UI.

## Features
- **PDF Parsing**: Extracts text from service manuals while preserving structure.
- **RAG Pipeline**: Chunking, Embedding, and Retrieval using FAISS.
- **LLM Extraction**: Structured JSON extraction of vehicle specs (Torque, Fluids, Clearances, etc.).
- **Interactive UI**: Streamlit-based interface for uploading manuals and querying specs.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository** (or navigate to `vehicle-spec-extractor/`)
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Set up Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
    # Optional: HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN if using HF inference API
    ```
4.  **Run the Streamlit App**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage
1.  Upload a Service Manual PDF via the sidebar.
2.  Click "Build Knowledge Base" to process the PDF.
3.  Enter a query (e.g., "Torque for cylinder head bolts") or use the sample buttons.
4.  View extracted specifications in JSON or Table format.
